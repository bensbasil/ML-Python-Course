# 📘 Machine Learning Course Notes (Python)

This repository contains my **personal learning notes, code examples, and practice notebooks** while studying **Machine Learning using Python**.

The goal of this repo is not to be a polished library, but a **clear, structured learning journey** — from fundamentals to applied ML concepts.

---

## 📌 What this repository contains

- 📓 Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with explanations and experiments  
- 🐍 Python scripts for practice and concepts  
- 📊 Data handling examples using Pandas & NumPy  
- 🤖 Machine Learning models built using scikit-learn  
- 🧠 Notes written while learning (mistakes included — and fixed)

This repo reflects **active learning**, not copied tutorial code.
